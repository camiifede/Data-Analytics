# Data-Analytics
London Pollution Analysis Dashboard
# Project Description:
The London Pollution Analysis Dashboard is an interactive business intelligence tool designed to visualize and analyze pollution levels across different areas of London. This project addresses the growing concern of air quality and public health by providing insights into toxic elements such as carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). By identifying areas with the highest pollution levels, the dashboard aims to inform policymakers and the public, enabling more effective environmental strategies and health interventions.
# Tech Stack:
• Power BI: For data visualization and dashboard creation

• Data Sources: Environmental pollution datasets

• Statistical Analysis Tools: Built-in Power BI functionalities

• Visualization Libraries: Power BI visualization options
